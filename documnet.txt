===== Changes Log =====
Date: 2026-02-19

--- File Modified: Dockerfile ---
Location: e:\sdc-joint.ai\backend\sdc-joint-ai\Dockerfile

What was changed:
- Completely rewrote the Dockerfile from scratch.

Previous state:
- Used ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:python3.13-bookworm-slim as base image (UV package manager).
- WORKDIR was /app.
- Dependencies installed via `uv sync --locked` using pyproject.toml and uv.lock.
- Ran with `uv run src/agent.py start`.
- Had a non-privileged appuser setup.
- Had a pre-download step: `uv run src/agent.py download-files`.

New state:
- Base image: python:3.13-slim-bookworm (standard Python image, no UV).
- WORKDIR: /sdc-joint-ai (as requested).
- Creates a Python virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`.
- Installs dependencies with: `pip install -r requirement.txt`.
- Runs the app with: `venv/bin/python src/agent.py start`.
- Removed the non-privileged user setup for simplicity.
- Removed the `download-files` pre-download step.
- Kept build dependencies (gcc, g++, python3-dev) for native extensions.

--- AWS Deployment Guide Created (Console UI Version) ---
Location: Artifact file (aws_deployment_guide.md)

  Create Task Definition with env vars → Create Service → Verify logs.
- Only terminal commands needed: Docker build & push (4 commands).
- Estimated cost: ~$35-45/month.

--- SQL Schema File Created ---
Location: e:\sdc-joint.ai\backend\sdc-joint-ai\supabase_schema.sql

What was created:
- Complete Supabase SQL schema with 6 tables:
  1. helpdesk_requests (requester_name, requester_email, phone_number, request_text, status)
  2. student_complaints (student_name, student_email, department, complaint_text, status)
  3. clubs (club_name, description, head_of_club, contact_email)
  4. club_programs (club_id FK->clubs, program_name, description, program_date, start_time, end_time, venue)
  5. events (event_name, description, event_date, start_time, end_time, venue, department, registrationlink)
  6. exam_timetable (semester, subject_name, exam_date, exam_time, venue, department)
- All tables have RLS (Row Level Security) policies enabled.
- Public read + helpdesk/complaints have public insert.
- Everything else requires authenticated user for insert/update/delete.
- No storage buckets used.

--- Skill/Workflow File Created ---
Location: e:\sdc-joint.ai\.agent\workflows\supabase-schema.md
- Step-by-step instructions for running the SQL in Supabase SQL Editor.
- Column reference documentation for all 6 tables.
